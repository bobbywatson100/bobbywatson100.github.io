On a whim, I reinstalled Tomb Raider (2013) on my gaming PC this week, and started playing it. I have very mixed feelings about this game (despite the fact that this is the third time I'm playing through it), which I will probably detail in another post later once I finish it.

Playing this game through Moonlight on my Raspberry Pi is a charm: the visual quality is excellent, and so is the framerate. Despite its age, this game still looks great. At the time I first played it, I remember thinking "I don't care if games ever look better than this, this is good enough". This opinion has not changed.
