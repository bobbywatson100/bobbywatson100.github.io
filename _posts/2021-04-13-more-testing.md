I've spent some time testing this game today over wi-fi. It was not a good experience, due to input lag. It's not much, but enough to be noticeable and make a relatively simple platforming section in the second level of the game somewhat tricky (especially for the jumps).

I tried a few other things as well:
- Ethernet over power lines -- Better, but still noticeable. I did not run into any video issues though, the frame rate was constant and did not notice any compression artifacts.
- Wired both PC and the Raspberry Pi into the same router -- About the same as ethernet over power lines. Maybe a tiny bit better, but still noticeable.

So, at this point, I'm not convinced this can work, at least not for action game that require precise timing. This should be fine for anything turn-based though.
