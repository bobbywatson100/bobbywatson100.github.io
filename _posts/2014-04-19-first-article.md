Since I don't think anybody will ever read this blog, I can say whatever I want, right?

Anyway, not much to add at the moment. I will probably publish a new page later this week displaying the current status of the backlog (which I believe has over 300 games in it) and games I beat since the beginning of the year. I will also publish short reviews of games as I complete them. *Anachronox* (PC) is first in line. (Spoiler: It will be a pretty mixed review.)
