Over the past few weeks, I've decided to test Moonlight instead of SteamLink. Results have been... mixed.

The program is actually very easy to install via the RetroPie-Setup script. It is available in the 'experimental' packages. There is a specific command available to automatically create shortcuts, so games can be started directly from the RetroPie menu (under the 'Steam' category).

One problem I encountered right away: For whatever reason, my DualShock 4 was recognized as 'Wireless Controller', not as a DS4, and the button configuration was all messed up. I tried to figure out how to change it, but gave up after about an hour, and went back to using a Dual Shock 3 (also wirelessly), which was properly recognized and works as expected.

The first game I tried, of course, was the original *Tomb Raider*. SteamLink had some noticeable input lag issues. It is not the case with Moonlight. Everything worked perfectly. Same with *Tomb Raider II*. I was able to beat both games without any kind of issue. The visual quality looked even better than using Steam streaming.

Other games I've tried with Moonlight:
- *The Legend of Heroes: Trails to Azure* (thanks to the recently released translation mod for the PC version). I've played about 10 hours so far and I have yet to encounter any issue. Again, the video quality is top notch, and the inputs work great (using a Dual Shock 3).
- *The Lego Ninjago Movie Videogame*: This game is surprisingly fun and funny (especially since I got it for free last year during a promotion). I have found two issues: Anytime I need to rotate the left analog stick, the motion is not detected properly, making those puzzles virtually impossible to complete, and the game will crash randomly when streaming. I tried the rotation puzzles on my PC directly with an Xbox One controller, and it worked as expected, and without crashes.
- *Valkyria Chronicles*: I can hear the sound, and that's it. The screen stays black when streaming this game through Moonlight. I tried it with SteamLink, and have not encountered any issue there. I did some Googling, and the same issue occurs on an Nvidia Shield device as well.
- *Tomb Raider: Legend*: Again, seems to work great with Moonlight. I had two issues playing this through SteamLink: the game was too dark, and the analog sticks were too sensitive. I haven't encountered either of them with Moonlight.
