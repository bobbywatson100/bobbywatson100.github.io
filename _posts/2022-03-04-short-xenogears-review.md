Just finished *Xenogears* for the second time. (I think I finish it back in... 2001? something like that). I think the game can best be described as a fascinating and unfinished clusterfuck.

And yet, I think I loved it?

I think a good chunk of what is on the first disc could have been either cut or shortened significantly to allow the second disc to be more fleshed out than it is. It makes me wonder whether the writers actually had the whole story planned from the beginning, or if they made it up as they went along.

Graphically, it's a PS1 game, and navigating the 3D environments is not always obvious. Some areas have maps, and they're useful, but I wished they could have been integrated in the main game's UI. The platforming sections (particularly the infamous Tower of Babel) are pretty bad. I found the sprites to be pretty well done though.

With SquareEnix recently re-releasing some of its PS1 games (*Chrono Cross*, *SaGa Frontier*, *Legend of Mana*, *Front Mission 2*), I can't help thinking *Xenogears* will be receiving the same treatment at some point. Since SE took the time to add some of the cut content in the original *SaGa Frontier* for the re-release, I'm hoping they can do the same for *Xenogears*. While it's not exactly a masterpiece, I think it is still pretty good, and deserves another chance to shine.

### Streaming notes

I played most of the game in Retroarch with the Beetle PSX HW core, streaming from my PC to my Chromecast with Google TV and the Android Moonlight app, and the whole thing ran like butter. I've read that one boss fight in the second disc can cause soft locks with anything that is not an actual PS1, but did not encounter it in my playthrough.
