I had been hearing good words about this game from various podcasts for the past six months. Thanks to the Epic Store coupon, I finally pulled the trigger on that one. Considering I beat the whole thing in a weekend, I'd say it was worth it.

Despite hearing a lot about the game, I wasn't sure what to expect. I had heard about the basic premise, but that was pretty much it. The gameplay is pretty simple at first: walk around this Roman city, talk to the folks, and solve the mystery. There is more than that. Eventually. But I won't go over it as to avoid spoilers. This is one game where you don't want to be spoiled. The various stories are quite interesting, and the overall plot, while fairly predicable at a certain point, was entertaining enough to keep me going and going, and there were plenty of surprises along the way.

I had a great time exploring the city, uncovering and solving its mysteries, talking to its inhabitants! The city itself is very well done.

On the technical side, I encountered some weird issues:
- I was unable to create a shortcut for the game using the Epic game launcher UI. I thought I was doing something wrong, but I tried with another game and I had no issue.
- I got a bunch of achievements while I was playing, yet they don't show up on my Epic account.

From an in-home streaming point of view, I tried playing this through Moonlight with my Raspberry Pi, and again encountered some annoyances:
- No on-screen keyboard (for the one place where I had to type my character's name)
- There was a weird drift whenever I stopped moving. I want to try playing this with the iOS version of Moonlight to see if it's a problem with the Pi/Dual-Shock 3 combination.

I gave up on streaming the game and played it on my older Alienware Alpha instead.
