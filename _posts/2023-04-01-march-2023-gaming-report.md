### Purchased:
* Final Fantasy IX (PC) - For the GWJ JRPG club, I wanted to test the mod that upgrades all backgrounds

### Completed:
* Toem + DLC (PS5) - Short and super charming
* Tomb Raider III (1998) - Yes, two replays back to back. And no, there won't be a third replay for a little while.
* Tchia  (PS5) - Like _Toem_, short and super charming. I encountered a few annoying bugs along the way. Even got the platinum trophy.

### Dropped:
* Titanfall 2 (PS5) - I got bored roughly 2/3 in and just decided to drop it. Shooters are not my thing I guess.

### Ramblings:
Another very slow month. I feel like my gaming time has shrunk significantly this year. I see this as a good thing. Part of the reason is that I just don't really know what to play. I dropped _Titanfall 2_ when I realized, as I was playing it, that I'd rather be replaying _Tomb Raider III_. 

Blasphemy, I know. 

I started _Toem_ on a whim on a Thursday and, while that was enjoyable, it only took about 6 hours to get the platinum trophy (+2 hours for the DLC), which was the perfect length for that game.

After that, I didn't want to start a long RPG, considering that the voting for the next JRPG game club was right around the corner. I had a bunch of games installed on my PS5, but none of them was catching my eye. And then _Tchia_ showed up, so I picked it up (thanks, Playstation Plus Extra) and played through it. 

I don't know if this is a consequence of me ditching the backlog completely about a year ago, but I am seriously considering selling some of my older consoles. The Wii U, PS Vita et PS TV are currently all on the chopping block. Going through my Wii U library, there's nothing I haven't repurchased on the Switch or that I can't emulate in one way or another. As for the Vita... well, poor Vita, outside of _Freedom Wars_ and _Soul Sacrifice Delta_, you really never managed to keep me interested. I'm hoping I can retrieve my save games for both of those and emulate them later. Would be nice if they could get HD remasters or something, but at this point it looks like they will both end up lost to time. The NES Classic and SNES Classic I could probably sell as well. They were nice, but I'd rather play whatever is on them elsewhere. 

One thing of note: For the first time in I don't know how long, I did not buy anything in the Spring Steam sale. Go me! I also managed to avoid going on a shopping spree on the final days of the 3DS eShop (RIP).
