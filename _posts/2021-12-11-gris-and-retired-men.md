Yesterday, I bought two games: *Gris* and *Retired Men's Nude Beach Volleyball League*. The former had been in my Steam wishlist for ages. I became aware of the latter during Summer, and it had piqued my interest even if, after watching the trailer, it didn't look like a particularly good game. Playing both to completion in parallel, in less than 24 hours, has been an interesting experience.

*Gris* is a puzzle platformer. The animations are detailed and very well realized. Its graphical style is extremely polished. The music is fantastic. It has some clever puzzles that are actually not that hard to complete. There is an underlying theme of grief and overcoming depression. It takes itself fairly seriously.

On the other hand, *Retired Men's Nude Beach Volleyball League* feels like a game that was thrown together in a weekend by two friends after getting drunk on a Friday night. The gameplay is rough, the graphics are primitive, there are plenty of bugs, the text has typos and grammatical errors (that even someone for whom English is not their first language notices). The volleyball is not very fun to play and the matches go on for too long. Yet, it also has its charm, and I thought the ending wrapped the whole thing pretty beautifully.

Of the two, *Gris* was definitely a better experience, but I had fun with both nonetheless.

Quick note regarding in-home streaming using Moonlight: *Gris* worked flawlessly. *Volleyball League* requires a mouse in some areas (navigating the settings and exiting the game).
