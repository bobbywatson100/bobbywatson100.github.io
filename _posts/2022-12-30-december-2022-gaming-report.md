### Ramblings:
It's been almost a year since I deleted the "Backlog" spreadsheet from my Excel document. I'm not sure how I feel about it. On the one hand, it was nice to just get rid of it, but on the other hand I still think about it, and I'm slowly building a mental list of games I'd like to play at some point in the future. And I also track the list of games I buy (for budgeting reasons) in the same Excel document, so that provides another way for me to figure out what I have purchased but not played yet. One improvement I will make moving forward is just writing the platform, store and amount of the game, not keeping track of the titles. I will still have the receipts in my email archive (or in the game box for the rare physical game), if I ever need to figure out what game I bought on a specific date (which, let's face it, is unlikely to happen).

I was hoping to get *Persona 3 Portable* done this month, but it keeps not happening. I barely touched the game in December, after making good progress in November. I will do my best to rush through it in the first week of January, as I will be starting a new job on January 9th, and I also want to start *Tales of Arise* for the JRPG club (I have it installed and ready to go on my PC).

### 2023 Game Plan
Same as always: Buy fewer games, play the ones I already own. We'll see how that goes.

The only games I plan to purchase next year so far are:
- The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV (PC)
- The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (Switch)

I will end up buying more than that, of course, depending on what I want to play, the JRPG game club, and sales.
