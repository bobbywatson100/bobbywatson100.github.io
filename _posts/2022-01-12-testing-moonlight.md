For whatever reason, I suddenly decided that I wanted to consolidate my old Chromecast and the Retropie into one device. My initial idea was to get an Apple TV and use Xcode to load Kodi and Retroarch on it, but after a bit of research, I realized that this was a stupid idea. Asking around, someone suggested using a Chromecast with Google TV. I looked into it, and decided to give it a shot.

So far, so good! I had no issue connecting a DS4 controller to the device, and Moonlight seems to be working as well as it did on the Retropie and, unlike on Retropie, the list of games refreshes automatically. (I had connectivity issues initially, but rebooting my router fixed them, which may be a sign that I need to upgrade that thing, especially considering it's no longer getting security updates.)

The main issue I had was getting my ROMs on the thing, but after trying a significant number of apps from the Play store, I found one that allowed me to do it. Storage space is very limited though, so if I decide to give PS1 games a shot, I probably won't put that many of them on it.
