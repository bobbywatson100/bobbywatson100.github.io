I need to get into the habit of writing reviews more often. Though that is not likely to happen.

Anyway, *Valiant Hearts - The Great War*. Published by Ubisoft in June 2014 on a multitude of platforms, developed by Ubisoft Montpellier. Certainly one of the good surprises of the year for me. I bought it for the art style. And also because it was on sale on Steam. I figured this would be a nice, short holiday game. It was short, all right. It was very nice, as well. But it certainly did not put me in a good mood. Especially not after finishing it.

The game has you playing as one of four distinct characters (Émile, a French farmer, Karl, a German young man who gets drafted into the German army, married to Émile's daughter, Freddie, an American expatriate, and Anna, a young Belgian woman) and Walt the Dog, all caught in the middle of a war known as The Great War, aka World War I. The game is divided into four chapters, and each chapter is composed of a variety of small vignettes, highlighting specific elements that are typically associated with WWI (trench warfare, poison gases, the arrival of tanks on battlefields, zeppelins, etc.) Each section is played using a different character or two. To move the story forward, the player has to solve some (usually fairly simple) puzzles, in typical adventure game fashion: Find object A, bring it to NPC B, find a way to move object C to clear the path. The game is sometimes interrupted with simple action sequences where the player is controlling a car and has to avoid bombs, mines and enemy fire, or (when playing as Anna) rescuing injured NPCs by playing some sort of rythm mini-game (which is the most annoying and frustrating part of the game). Movement is strictly 2D.

One cool thing about the game is its art style. It is very comic-booky: all characters, backgrounds, objects, have very clear black outlines, and it's all drawn in a manner that reminds of old French comic books (Franquin's *Spirou* albums are the ones that came to my mind) . The backgrounds are detailed and look amazing on a big screen TV, and vary from dark forests, to destroyed cities, bunkers, trenches, mines... The colour palette is somewhat muted, but that is very much in line with the subject.

The real star of the game, however, is the story. I got attached to the characters very quickly. They are very human, very simple and relatable people who get involved (not on their own accord) in events bigger than they are, and they try to survive as well as they can, attempting to find their loved ones in the middle of one of human history's darkest hour. It is sometimes funny, but usually pretty dramatic. The ending had me in tears. I have not been moved by a piece of entertainment like this since Lars Von Trier's *Dancer in the Dark*.

As the story progresses, the player can access historical facts regarding some of the events depicted in the game. The texts are short, very interesting and very relevant to the game. This game also aims to educate, and succeeds very well in that department. Also unlocked are various diary entries by the main characters, adding some extra bits of character developments. These are entirely optional. And also well written. And fun to read.

Also good: The music. From the very French piano main theme (which reminded me a lot of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's *A Very Long Engagement*, a movie about WWI), the more comedic moments (there are a few, mostly related to the main villain of the game, Baron Von Dorf) to the appropriately sad ending song, it's all good. I might actually have to buy the soundtrack for this.

As any Ubisoft game, this one has collectibles in it. They are far from meaningless here, though. Each one is associated with an interesting fact regarding the life of soldiers or civilians during World War I. I am not quite sure how I feel about them. On the one hand, they are a distraction and, as someone who is slightly obsessive-compulsive, missing one of them was somewhat frustrating (though I eventually got over it). On the other hand, they don't feel gratuitous at all, and actually add to the educational value of the game. At least the games make it possible (and easy) to replay portions of the game and find the ones the player may have missed.

Side-note:

I played this on my home theater PC, streaming the game from my main PC. I was pleasantly surprised by how well this worked in my house. I had zero problem, outside of the fact that the game crashed once on me.
