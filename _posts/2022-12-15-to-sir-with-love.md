For whatever reason, over the past two or three years, I've watched a fairly big number of TV shows from Thailand. Once in a while I find one that is actually good (*A Tale of a Thousand Stars* comes to mind), but usually they're... mediocre. 

This week, I started watching *To Sir, With Love* (released officially on YouTube). And I'm completely hooked. I've watched nine episodes in three days (out of 17).

This is a soap opera. About a Chinese mafia family in Bangkok, during World War II. It has a somewhat clueless mafia patriarch. He has three wives, and two of them hate and are constantly plotting against each other. Each of the two has a son, and they're both trying to get them to succeed their father (although one of them is not interested). In the first episode, the patriarch's brother is outed as gay while his lover is being beaten in the middle of a family council. The brother slits his own throat in the next scene. Then, a bit later, the second wife tries to kill the patriarch's first son (from the first wife) by throwing a (bad CGI) snake near the kid. 

What follows (after a 12 year time jump) is something that alternates between soap opera stuff and vaudeville (although I guess it could be argued that 'soap opera' and 'vaudeville' are synonyms). There's A LOT of eavesdropping. And murders. And murders to cover up a murder. And magic mushrooms (not the fun kind). More eavesdropping. Brotherly love (which, surprisingly, is not incestuous). There's a killer maid. There are rats in a coffin that eat the cadaver's face off. A dead body is swapped somehow, and nobody seems to care where the spare came from (or who it is). There's a very handsome killer-for-hire with a heart of gold. The wives use a lot of lipstick. And then there's more eavesdropping. And the music is way over the top.

There's a traitor. I mean, of course there's a traitor.

Some of the acting is not great. The second wife is so theatrical, it's comical. Her maid is the worst. The first wife is amazing though. The dresses she wears are incredible.

I started watching the show somewhat ironically, but now I can't stop. I don't know if this qualifies as "so bad, it's good". It's bonkers and I love it.

### Quick life update
When I finished my work contract at the end of October, I didn't know how long it would take me to find another one. I was expecting six months at least, but it turns out I'm going back to work in January. I plan to keep working on my game in the evenings, but I expect the pace to be pretty slow.
