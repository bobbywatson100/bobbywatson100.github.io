To be brutally honest: The only reason I finished The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass is because I was away from home with only my Dsi XL and nothing else to play. Otherwise I would have given up on it long before I got to the end. If Nintendo was to revisit that game, I think it could be something great though!

I have two major problems with this game:
1. Stylus controls. I get that Nintendo wanted to showcase all the features of the DS in a Zelda game, but I found it annoying as heck. (I will say, though, that stylus controls were great for one thing: using Bom-chus. That's it.)
2. The stupid dungeon I had to go through multiple times throughout the game. On a timer. Yes, there is a shortcut at some point, but it came way too late for me to alleviate the issue. And there's only one shortcut. There should be more.

I still had fun going through the game's various dungeons and puzzles. It looked OK on my DSi XL's screens. I played most of the game with the sound off, so I can't say much about the music, other than what I heard was pretty bland.

I'm still glad I played it. Due to the platform it was made for, I get the impression that this is a Zelda game that will get lost to time (along with Spirit Tracks). This is unfortunate. With a few tweaks, this game could really be a great, short Zelda game! As it is now though, I have no desire to ever play it again.
