### Ramblings:
For whatever reason, I decided that it was time to get rid of my Wii U and the two physical games I have for it. The console sold the same day I listed it on Kijiji, *Xenoblade Chronicles X* sold a few days later. I'm still hoping I can find a taker for *Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate*. I think the PS Vita and PS TV are next on the chopping block. I haven't touched them in quite some time.  I expect to list them on various marketplaces in the coming weeks. 

Four months in, and I have not completed a single game from my priority list. I'm... not sure how I feel about that.

The only big game I beat this month was *Haven*. It was... fine. I really liked the first five or six hours, but by the seventh it was obvious that the game was just going to be a repeat of what I'd already done, with some new story content here and there. The game looks pretty good, the voice acting is OK, and I'm happy the developer added options to play as a same-sex couple (I played as a gay couple). The music was also excellent (and it's available on Apple Music, which is great). Despite the fact that it only took me about 15 hours to get through, I thought the game did overstay its welcome by a few hours. The combat was also very repetitive and, once I figured out a strategy that worked, I never really had to change it significantly (though I'm sure there are better ways to use the combat system).

I recently discovered that there was a decompilation project for all of the five classic _Tomb Raider_ games, with some improvements, so I decided to try the first one. Overall, it's probably the best way to play the game today, and the installer made the whole process pretty painless (provided I had the game installed on Steam). After playing the first game, I decided to play the game's expansion, _Unfinished Business_. I know I have beaten it in the past (on the Mac), but I remembered exactly none of it. Overall, I liked the levels, but the combat was a pain, with enemies that are bullet sponges, in very inconvenient areas. Looking at the source code, I found the enemy hit points so, next time I want to replay it, I'm going to reduce all those numbers by at least 50%, compile the executable, and then play it. I just need to figure out what dependencies I need, I haven't worked with C compilers in... decades.

I also found a mod for _Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness_ (the only mainline _TR_ game I haven't played) that apparently makes that game playable. I definitely plan to give this one a try, since it's the only mainline *TR* game I haven't played.
