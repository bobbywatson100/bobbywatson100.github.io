The new computer showed up early last week, and I've been testing various thing since. And now I'm finally getting to testing the streaming to my Raspberry Pi.

One game I've been replayed a lot in recent years is the original *Tomb Raider*. Yes, that super ugly and blocky game from 1996, featuring Lara Croft's triangular chest. I think I've played the thing from start to finish at least six times in the past four years.

The issue with this game is that controller support is... problematic. Considering the game was made long before the Xbox 360 controller became the standard in PC gaming, that's understandable. Luckily, Steam now has built-in input mapping, which can map controller buttons to keyboard keys. And, when using a Steam version of a game, it is fairly easy to import other people's configurations.

To get this working, I first installed the GOG version of the game. Then, I downloaded the Tomb Raider Automated Fix installer. By default, GOG runs the DOS version of the game through DOSBox. The automated fix installer makes it easy to run the Windows version of the game in widescreen, at high resolution, in addition to updating the FMVs if you so desire. I then added a custom shortcut in Steam pointing to the 'tombati.exe' executable, gave it a proper name, added some custom artwork, and enabled controller support. Since this was a custom shortcut, I was unable to import someone else's configuration. Making a new one wasn't too hard by looking up the original PS1 configuration and matching it.

So, how did it go when I tried to steam it to my Raspberry Pi? I'm not sure.

The picture quality is perfectly fine. The problem is controlling the game. My performances at the game were not that great. I'm not 100% sure where this comes from. It could be that there is a very minimal but noticeable input delay. Or it could be that I'm using a PS3 controller. After years of using nothing but a DS4 and an Xbox One controller, going back to the DS3 felt cramped and awkward.

Anyway, I will keep playing some more this week. I plan to test again with a DS4, we'll see if things improve. I'm not optimistic.
