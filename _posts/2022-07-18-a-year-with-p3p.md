I recently picked up *Persona 3* again (before the recent port announcements), and so far, it’s been an… interesting experience.

I think this is my fourth or fifth time trying to play through it. This time, I decided to take a slower approach: I started playing it on April 9th (the day the game starts), with the goal of playing one in-game day each day. This did not go exactly as planned due to various life issues, and the fact that I decided to switch from *FES* to *Portable* in early June means I had to start over. However, after a month and a half, I am finally caught up! I don’t expect this to be the case very long, I want to go to Tartarus today but I won’t have time for that, so July 18th will spill into July 19th, and possibly July 20th as well. I should be able to catch up on Saturday. As long as I play a bit every day, I expect I can keep up the pace (and catch up on weekends if I need to.)

From my perspective, *Portable* fixes the two biggest issues I had with *FES*:
1. When I exit Tartarus, I can go back in at the exact same floor I was at, without having to reach a teleporter
2. Characters don’t really get tired anymore. They DO get tired, but it’s not as big of a pain as it was in *FES* (although I discovered recently that it's possible to reset the 'tired' timer by resetting the game -- something to keep in mind if I ever revisit *FES*).

I’m not a big fan of the other changes though: I prefer the free exploration rather than the menu-based navigation, and the downgrade in the 3D models is pretty jarring when played on a big screen TV. And I do wish Atlus brings back the anime cutscenes for the future ports (but I am not optimistic they will).

My previous attempts at playing this game (all with *FES*, not *Portable*) ended at some point in June. I was always hitting a wall in Tartarus, and could never survive long enough to reach the next teleporter, and I would eventually stop trying and give up. This time things seem to be going OK, but I still find the deadlines very stressful for some reason. Knowing that my characters are going on a vacation for the next week (after a week of exams where I was unable to do anything), I started panicking this morning, looking at the date, thinking ‘Oh sh*t, when they’re back from vacation, I will only have 10 days to reach the next stopping point!’ However, I am still enjoying playing the game, and playing it only a small bit every day makes it less of a grind.

Not sure I’m enjoying the social links though. I really feel that the point of them is just to be a sociopath and say whatever the person actually wants to hear, not what should be said, even in cases where the characters are being stupid. (I’m looking at you, Kenji, Kazushi and Mr President of the Student Council.)

Will I keep going, or will this attempt at beating *Persona 3* finish like the others before it? I guess I will find out in the coming months! So far, it looks like this might be the one time I make it across the finish line.
