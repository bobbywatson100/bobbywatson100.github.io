### Ramblings:
After a few months of consideration, I finally subscribed to PS+ Extra, mostly because the selected game for the JRPG game club was included (*Ys IX: Monstrum Nox*). Also included: *Stray*! Despite the game being relatively short, I ended up playing it for a good 16 hours, and I managed to get the platinum trophy in the process. Overall, Stray is my game of the year so far!

The rest of the month was devoted to *Ys IX*. It was good and, at roughly 35 hours, it didn't overstay its welcome.

I also decided to drop *Gravity Rush 2* earlier this week. The game isn't bad. Its world is amazing, and shifting gravity is an interesting concept. My biggest problem was the boring missions. I made it about halfway through back in September. After a month of not playing it and thinking I should go back to it, I came to the realization that I'm probably never going to, and to just let it go. 

My big game for November is going to be *Persona 3 Portable*. I made it to floor 135 back in September, and reached a boss I was not able to beat at the time. Now that I have the game running on my Steam Deck (thank you, Emu Deck), it will be my main game for November. I think my save game is on September 26th. I have not decided if I'm only going to try and catch up and stick with my day-to-day play through, or just get to the end. We shall see.

Also on my list for November: *Live-A-Live*. I bought it for Switch back in July and I haven't touched it yet. 

With my work contract being over, my projects for the rest of the year are:
- Prep for JLPT N4 (I think I have the kanji, vocab and grammar mostly figured out, but the listening part has the potential to be my downfall)
- Complete the conversion to Godot 4 of my earlier game development efforts
- Practice drawing (mostly gesture)
- Hit the gym every day
- Finish layout and design of this very blog
