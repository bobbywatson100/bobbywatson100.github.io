For the past few years, I've been using a web app called 'WaniKani' to learn and practice kanji. I've managed to make it to the end of the program, and I am almost done 'burning' all the radicals, kanji, and vocab words. (In WaniKani speak, 'Burning' means you've learned something, and it won't ever come up in your reviews again, unless you reset the item to its first level.)

I recently met a Japanese person with whom I have an occasion to practice speaking. And he (unwittingly) threw me a curve ball recently, by asking 調子はどう? I 'burned' the word 調子 a long time ago.  I should have known what he asked. And yet, I didn't. It was only after I looked it up that I figured it out. So, of course, I used the reset button on that word, and it is now back in my review queue, but that brought up the question: 

How many more words have I burned but forgotten?

The reason why I have forgotten them is simple: I should be reading and listening to Japanese more often. Pretty much every day, in fact. And I have recently gotten into the habit of doing so. The keyword here is 'recently'. And I do think it has been beneficial. I have seen plenty of kanji and vocabulary words from WaniKani that I had already forgotten.

I can think of a few options moving foward:
1. Continue with reading every day, continue doing whatever reviews I have in WaniKani, and bring kanji and vocab back from the dead whenever I encounter something I've forgotten.
2. Give up WaniKani completely, put my account on vacation mode so reviews don't accumulate, and just use it as a reference.
3. Reset WaniKani entirely, and start over. 

I've considered option 2 many times in the past.  And I've put my account on vacation mode for months at a time, but I've always gone back eventually.

But, in the end, I went with 3. Mostly because, since I've already been through it, it should be easier the second time around, and hopefully not as time consuming. Adding 10 items a day should give me a good number of reviews, and I should not fail them as often as I did the first time around. At 10 items at days, this should take about 2.5 years. I might try to go a bit faster at first. We shall see.

And, if that doesn't work out, option 2 is still available.
