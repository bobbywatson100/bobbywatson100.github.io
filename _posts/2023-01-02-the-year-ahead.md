Despite the world in 2022 being kind of a shitshow, and some family things adding another later of crap to the mix, I have to say 2022 was a pretty good year for me. 

When I quit my previous contract in April 2021, I thought it would take me two or three months to find another one. It ended up taking 10. When my contract ended in October 2022 (after multiple extensions), I was expecting the same amount of downtime. It turns out it only took two months, and I'm starting another job next week. (Which reminds me that I still have not tested the VPN access I got two weeks ago.)

As things are now, here are my thoughts regarding the first half of 2023:

1. I've been wanting to travel back to Japan since 2019 and, for a variety of reasons (some in my control, most not), the trip keeps getting pushed back. When I interviewed for my next contract in December, I was thinking that if I did not get the job, I would fly to Tokyo in February and stay there for a month. Obviously, that won't work. I still want to go, and I might end up doing it in the Spring instead (provided I can get at least three weeks off).
2. I'm not so sure about my game dev projects anymore. At least not the project I've been focusing on. I might end up putting it on ice and moving on to something else. I have ideas. We'll see if I can put them in motion.
3. These ideas will require me to learn how to use Blender. There's no way around it. 
4. Same with my art. I've had Andrew Loomis' *Figure Drawing For All It's Worth* for years, and I think now is the time to actually use it. 
5. Ditto with digital art programs. I recently purchased Affinity Phot and Affinity Designer, on both computer and iPad. 

That's a lot for me. I don't think I can get to everything. Japan is top priority (but the dates are flexible, as long as it's not Summer). Art and Blender are next, since they're a requirement for all my future game development projects.

With regards to game playing, there are a few games I want to play and complete this year:
- Persona 3 Portable (about 70% done)
- Tales of Arise (just started)
- Myst (for research purposes mostly)
- The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel III
- Live-A-Live
- Octopath Traveler
- The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV
- The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (the only game I plan to buy on day 1 this year)
