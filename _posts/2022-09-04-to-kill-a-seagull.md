Though I read the book almost 20 years ago, one of the moments I remember most from Yann Martel's *Life of Pi* is the scene where Pi catches his first fish, and just can't find the resolve to kill it. He ends up wrapping the fish in rags before breaking its neck. 

I was confronted with a similar situation a week ago. I was out jogging and, as I was about to turn to go back to the building where I live, I noticed a seagull on the ground. I ran next to it, but it did not fly away. Instead, it tried to move, but just could not. I found that weird, but did not give it too much thought.

About an hour later, as I was going out to get to the bus stop, I saw the bird again. I looked at it a bit more closely, and I noticed that it was in a very bad shape: it's right wing was almost torn off, and its left leg looked broken and could barely move. My guess is that it was hit by a car but somehow survived.

Somebody had clearly seen the bird too, because they left a small bowl of water with some bread in it. The bird was pretty far from it. I moved closer, and I saw the bird try to move away from me. It moved into the entrance. My roommate, who was with me at the time, suggested I move the seagull on the grass, which I did. (And yes, I used hand sanitizer after.) I brought the bowl next to it, so that it could drink.

All through the afternoon, I could not stop thinking about that bird. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that there was no way this bird would ever fly again. The damage to the wing was too great, I don't think it could even move it. It was probably in pain. All this time, my thinking was that I would have to kill it so that it would not suffer pointlessly.

By the time my roommate and I got back, the bird was gone. No trace of it remained. I don't know what happened. My guess is that security saw it and took it away. Or maybe a dog walked by and attacked it. I don't know, and I will probably never know. 

One other thing I will never know: Would I have killed it? I'm not sure. Maybe, like Pi, I would have had to wrap it with rags before breaking its neck.

One fun thing I learned on that day: Seagulls are very, very light, despite being fairly big birds.
