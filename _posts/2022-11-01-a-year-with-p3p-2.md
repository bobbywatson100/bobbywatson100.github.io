I was doing pretty well on my day-to-day playthrough of the game until the end of September, and then I got stock on the boss on Floor 135 of Tartarus and stopped playing. I started playing other things (*Ys IX* mostly) in October, and didn't touch the game until last weekend. I did managed to beat the boss by trying again and again, until I got lucky and Ken and Akihiko managed to land a few criticals (helped by the Rebellion skill), which allowed me to use a few all out attacks and finish it off. I would not recommend that strategy.

I'm still enjoying the game overall. I cringed at the beach vacation section. It reminded me of the Hawaii section of *Persona 5*. I can't fault Atlus for being consistent...

My save game is currently on September 25th. Since I'm currently out of a job, I think I may just forget the day-to-day structure and just get to the end. I think I should be able to finish the game this month, provided I don't get stuck on a boss like I did back in September.
