Summer is now officially over, the friend/temporary roommate who had been living with me for the past four months had to go back home because his visitor's visa expired (lots of tears were shed), my work contract is ending in 2 weeks (although I do expect a short extension), and I bought a Steam Deck (which hasn't shipped yet), so hopefully I get to play more in the near future! But for now, it's time for the September report!

### Purchased
- Stray (PS5, thanks to PS+)
- Ys IX: Monstrum Nox (PS5, also thanks to PS+)
- Mega Man 11 (PC/Steam)
- God Eater 3 (PC/Steam)

### Completed
- Submerged: Hidden Depths (PC/Epic)
- Tomb Raider 1996 (PC - Replay)

### Dropped
None

### Currently playing
- *Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3 Portable* (PSP) - Continuing my day-by-day playthrough - Playing once or twice a week. I'm a few days behind, but should be able to catch up this weekend (I got stuck on a boss on floor 135). I might decide to just get it done at some point though, especially if I'm going to be unemployed for a little while.
- *Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak* (PC/Steam) - Still playing mostly on Friday evenings with some GWJ folks.
- *Gravity Rush 2* (PS4) - I was really hoping to have that one done by the end of September, but I barely made it past the halfway mark. I'm enjoying it in short sessions (although I'm mostly sticking to main story missions).
- *Mega Man 11* (PC/Steam) - I played about 2 hours of this (according to Steam), and yet have not been able to beat a single level yet. That game's hard.
- *Stray* (PS5) - Just started. I should be able to beat it this weekend. I think it's going to be my game of the year. 
- *The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel III* (PC/Epic) - I think I made exactly zero progress this month.



### Planned purchases for the year
- ~~Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak (PC)~~ - Purchased
- ~~The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel 3 (PC)~~ - Purchased

### Ramblings
Another slow month for me in terms of videogames. Again, lots of running and some biking though!

I received the email to order a Steam Deck and, after thinking about it for an hour or two, I went ahead with the purchase. For some reason, orders for Canada are slow to ship, so who knows when I'm actually going to get it. I have a trip planned for Thanksgiving weekend, and I was hoping to get it before then, but that doesn't seem very likely at this point. **Edit**: It has now shipped and should be here Tuesday, October 4th, a few days ahead of my trip.

One of the reasons for me to get the Steam Deck is that I am finally getting back into game development and will be using it for testing. I've been documenting my progress on this very blog. Progress is slow, but has been picking up recently. 

A few months after getting rid of my backlog spreadsheet, I do notice that I am (somewhat unconsciously) starting to build a new one. If I listen to a podcast and they bring up a game I am interested in, I will add it to the mental list. As I am browsing the game collection on Playstation Plus, I'm thinking "I should play that", or "That looks good, maybe I should install it and play it after I'm done with X". If I'm looking at the list of this year's purchases, I find myself thinking "Oh yeah, I bought that, I need to play it". I'm not sure what to make of that (other than the fact that I like making lists and overwhelm myself with future tasks).
