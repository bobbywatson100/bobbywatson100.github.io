It is now possible to walk around in a scene in Godot 4:

I ran into some issues as I was importing the sprite, mostly due to how enums work in Godot 4. This was not my first time running into issues with enums, which makes me think that maybe I use them too much.

One huge issue though: I can't trigger the dialogs with the NPCs yet. I'm not sure why. I suspect it has something to do with the collision layers. I will look into it over the weekend. 

Another issue is the lighting. This is probably related to the global illumination thing I've heard about. I will definitely need to look into it (even though everything I've heard so far sounded like gibberish to me).

In short: Progress!
