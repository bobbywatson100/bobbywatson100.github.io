Continuing on *To Sir, With Love*, now that I have watched all 17 episodes. It took me 5 days. And I have thoughts. It's just not easy to put them together. 

In short: A mother tries to hide the fact that her son (and heir to a business association) is gay in Bangkok during World War II (and while Thailand is under Japanese occupation). It all goes downhill from there. Things get weird. Things get crazy. And then things get weirder and crazier.

I cringed. I laughed because it was funny. I laughed because something was absolutely ridiculous. I cried my eyes out. Boy, did I cry my fucking eyes out. Of sadness. Of happiness.

*To Sir, With Love* is intense. It goes in weird directions. It is terrible. At times, it is ridiculous. It is amazing. It is touching. It's a lot of fun. I could not stop watching.

I love Madam Li. I love Bua. Tian and Jiu are great together. Yang is the best half-brother ever.

I can't decide if *To Sir, With Love* is a dumpster fire or a fucking masterpiece.

It might actually be both.

...

Yes, it's both.

And now I'm going to rewatch the ending and cry myself to sleep.
