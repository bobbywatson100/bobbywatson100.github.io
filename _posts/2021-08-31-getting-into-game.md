I'm a longtime developer, but my career so far has been focused on business application development using the SAP ERP platform. If you don't know what that is, do yourself a favor and forget that it exists.

My current project is a turn-based beach soccer tactical game, with visual novel and dating sim elements, built using the Godot game engine. The working title is *The Saturday Amateur Beach Soccer League*.  This is currently in the prototyping phase, and there is a good chance it won't go any further. I will add more detail in a future post.
