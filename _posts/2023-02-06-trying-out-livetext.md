I was looking at the very few novels I have on my bookshelves this afternoon, and realized that the only ones I would be sad losing are written by Belgian writer Jean Ray, mostly because his works have been out of print for decades, and they are very hard to find second hand (at least here in Canada, and particularly in areas where French is not the main language, like Ottawa). He's written countless short stories under various names, a few novels, and some stuff he was not credited for. I don't think I've ever seen a complete list of everything he's written.

Jean Ray died in 1964. A quick lookup confirmed that, in Canada at least (but not in Belgium), his books are in the public domain. I searched online to see if they were available digitally. I found a few. Most notably *Malpertuis*, a short novel, one of his most well-known works. But aside from that, it was pretty disappointing. (Part of that reason, I assume, is because his work is not in the public domain in his native country, where it will not be public domain until 2034).

I thought: "Mmmh, maybe I could put a few short stories in eBook format out and help preserve his works." Probably a stupid thought, but hey. Which made me wonder what the best OCR programs were.

There's a whole bunch of them, but out of the lot, it turns out I already had one installed on my MacBook. Actually, it came with the system. It's called **LiveText**.

So I went ahead and tested it out with the introduction of one of his novels, *La Cité de l'indicible peur* (*The City of Unspeakable Fear*).

I took a photo of each of the 7 pages with my iPhone, AirDropped them on my MacBook Air, opened them in Preview. I was able to select the text (as I would in Word), copy it, and paste it in a Scrivener document. I re-read the whole thing, added/removed italics as needed, added section breaks where they should have been, and voilà! I had the whole thing done in about 20 minutes.

I had never used it before but, I have to admit, LiveText works *really* well, even on a book printed in 1971 with yellowed pages.

So, yeah, great work Apple!
