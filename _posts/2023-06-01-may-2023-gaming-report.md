### Purchased:
* The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (Switch)

### Completed:
* Tomb Raider II: The Golden Mask (PC/Steam) - This was like a hardcore version of Tomb Raider II, which is already quite hard. I liked it, and will likely play it again soon to get all the secrets I missed.

### Dropped:
* Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3 Portable (PSP) - Haven't touched it in months. I may end up watching the ending on YouTube instead. 
* Final Fantasy IX (PC) - GWJ JRPG club, replay. See ramblings.

### Currently playing:
* The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (Switch)
* Monster Hunter World Iceborne (PS5) - Trying to get the Platinum trophy for the Iceborne expansion. Damn those gold crowns.
* Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak (PC/Steam) - With the Friday GWJ group

### Planned purchases for 2023:
* ~~The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel 4 (PC)~~ - Purchased
* ~~The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (Switch)~~ - Purchased

### Priority games for 2023:
Nixed.

### Ramblings:
I just decided to completely nix my list of priority games for 2023. Mostly due to Zelda, but also due to the fact that, at this point, I am unlikely to get to any of them soon.

I previously said I was going to wait for my brother to be done with Zelda so I could borrow his copy, but the hype got to me. I've been enjoying it quite a bit, and look forward to the weekend to play more. I've spent somewhere between 20 and 30 hours on it so far, and I feel like I've barely made any progress (outside of around 40 shrines and 1 temple). I haven't even visited the depths yet.

With the Summer finally here, my gaming time is likely to go down, as I spend more time running and biking on weekends.
