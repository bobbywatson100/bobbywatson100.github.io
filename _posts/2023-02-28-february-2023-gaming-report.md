Short month, very little progress for some reason.

### Purchased:
* Star Trek Elite Force II (PC/GOG)
* Metal Gear Solid (PC/GOG)

### Completed:
* Tomb Raider III (1998) (PC/Steam) - Replay

### Dropped:
I thought I had dropped something this month, but I don't see anything in my spreadsheet.

### Currently playing:
* Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3 Portable (PSP)
* Monster Hunter World Iceborne (PS4) - Trying to get the Platinum trophy for the Iceborne expansion. Damn those gold crowns.
* Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak (PC/Steam) - With the Friday GWJ group
* Titanfall 2 (PS4) - Started on a whim and, even though I'm not a huge fan of FPS, I like it

### Planned purchases for 2023:
* ~~The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel 4 (PC)~~ - Purchased
* ~~The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (Switch)~~ - My brother is getting it, so I won't have to buy it, but that means I won't be able to play it at launch, which is fine with me.

### Priority games for 2023:
* Persona 3 Portable - Almost done, finally
* Myst remake
* Tales of Arise
* The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel III
* Octopath Traveler
* The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV
* The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom

### Ramblings:
Pretty slow month. For some reason, outside of Saturday and Sunday mornings, I haven't spent that much time playing games. I did spend a good amount of time on my art, so I'd say that's a good thing. 

Again, I have failed to finish Persona 3. I played some in early February, got my ass kicked by a boss, and I have not touched it since. I am so, so close to the end though...

I spent most of the month replaying Tomb Raider III. I liked it, but it is really hard. For some reason I started a replay immediately after finishing it, and I think I might use the cheat to get all the weapons. The Desert Eagle is so good!
