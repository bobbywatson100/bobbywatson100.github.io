It took some time, but I got something that vaguely looks like a soccer game showing up:

I spent way more time than I should have on the 3D model. This screenshot also has an issue with global illumination (all the blue sections should actually be white). The final game should have five players per team. I will be adding the goals and ball soon, and then the actual prototyping will start.
