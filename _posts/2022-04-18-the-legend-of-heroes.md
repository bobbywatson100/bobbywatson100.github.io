As I was going through the game, I kept thinking that the story of Trails in the Sky the 3rd was somewhat structured like Final Fantasy XIII: You're going through disjointed maps, linked together by mostly random plot points. The main difference is that here, you can go back anywhere. Not so much in FF XIII.

And, in both cases, I will admit I did not care for the story. I was expecting a story that would focus on the activities of the Septian church (which, so far, has been an organization of the Trails universe that has not received a lot of attention, and the atheist in me is very suspicious of it, as I am of most organized religions). We got a bit of that, but not that much. Instead, we get a story about a minor character, Kevin Graham, from Trails in the Sky SC that, to be fair, I did not really care about. I did come to like him in the end.

There are some good story bits here and there (the Renne backstory section stands out as a highlight, but one that should come with a trigger warning for child abuse, and has links with Trails from Zero that I completely missed when I played that game last year), but overall, I think it's totally skippable (unless you really like Kevin, I guess). Having played the Crossbell games, I found it interesting to see how some of the characters transitioned from their situations in Sky to where they are in Zero and Azure (Lechter and Kilika, in particular).

Graphically, it looks exactly like Sky FC, Sky SC, Zero and Azure, with 3D maps and sprites. It's perfectly fine. It reuses some assets from Sky FC and SC, but I believe most of the dungeons are new assets.

Overall, I'd say the game was fine but, unless you're a huge Trails fan and want to consume every single bit of content, I'd say it's skippable.
