I had a thought this week: What if I had no backlog?

I have to be perfectly honest with myself: I will never play all of the 250+ games that are currently included in my backlog. Even if I was able to retire today, at the age of ~~42~~43, I would have to do nothing but play games for the next 20 years to get to the end of it. And that's if I don't buy anything new.

I keep a carefully updated spreadsheet of all the games I buy and intend to play someday sorted alphabetically, with columns for platform, genre, year of purchase, estimated hours for completion, year of publication, and the occasional comment. In the same workbook, I keep a separate sheet for the games I buy, with prices, by year. And another sheet for the games I beat, with the approximate number of hours it took me to beat them. (I like making lists, don't judge me.)

I've used Backloggery and How Long To Beat to keep track of my backlog in the past, and yet I always go back to my spreadsheet. I've considered writing my own app to take care of it, with various frameworks like Ruby on Rails and Django, but eventually gave up on all of those attempts when I realized that the spreadsheet is a fine way to keep track of games I buy and haven't either beaten or given up on.

So, what if I grabbed that spreadsheet file from my OneDrive, dragged it to the Recycle Bin on my desktop, and then emptied the Recycle Bin, without keeping a backup of it anywhere?

I am going to be honest: Thinking about it fills me with dread. And I don't know why.

In the grand scheme of things, what are the consequences of not playing all the games on it? The truth is: There aren't any.

While there is some fear of missing out, I think the actual mental block is due to sunk-cost fallacy. I've paid for those games, so I should play them. The keyword here, I think, is "should". It sounds like an obligation.

It's not.

These are game, not items on a work to-do list. I do not have to play *Alpha Protocol*. The reviews at the time were pretty mixed. And yet, here it is, between the column header and *Alundra*, a PS1 game virtually no one remembers.

So, am I going to do it? I don't know.

What would it be like to live without having a backlog? I don't know, but the idea sounds pretty appealing!

What I might do is get rid of the backlog itself, but keep the list of games I buy and the ones I finish. I like being able to go back to the list of games I've beaten (or dropped) in a year, and to have an idea of what my game spending habits are.

If I do go ahead, though, it will be at the end of a long and painful thought process.
