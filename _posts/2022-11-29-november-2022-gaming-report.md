I have to admit: November flew by much faster than I thought it would!

### Purchased:
- Utawarerumono: Prelude to the Fallen (PC/Steam)
- The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt GOTY (PC/GOG)

### Completed:
- Tomb Raider II (PC) - Replay
- Tomb Raider Legend (PC) - Replay - Love that game, but for some reason that playthrough felt way glitchier than the last time I played it.

### Dropped:
None

### Currently playing:
- Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3 Portable (PSP) 
- Oceanhorn 2 (Apple Arcade)
- Utawarerumono: Prelude to the Fallen (PC/Steam) - Mostly because I've never really played a visual novel, so I figured I should play one if I'm going to make one
- Final Fantasy X Remaster (PC/Steam) - Replay
- Monster Hunter World Iceborne (PS4) - Trying to get the Platinum trophy
- Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak (PC/Steam) - With the Friday GWJ group

### Planned purchases for the year:
- ~~The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel 3 (PC)~~ - Purchased
- ~~Waiting for an Atlus sale on the 3DS eShop to buy a bunch of stuff for potential future play~~ - Done
- ~~Monster Hunter Rise (PC)~~ - Purchased
- ~~Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak (PC)~~ - Purchased
- ~~Final Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster (PC)~~ - For the JRPG game club
- ~~The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (Switch)~~ - Delayed to next year

### Ramblings:
I managed to resist most of the Black Friday sales, although I did end up buying *Witcher 3* for pennies. Some of the podcasts I'm listening to are doing a very good job of selling me on *Pentiment*, but so far I've resisted. 

Due to some other projects, I haven't been spending as much time gaming as I thought I would, and that's a good thing. I still managed to replay two *Tomb Raider* games, and made some significant progress in *Persona 3 Portable*. I thought I would be able to finish it in November, but I got sidetracked with JLPT preparation.

I am currently juggling 3 long JRPGs: *Persona 3*, *Utawarerumono*, and *Final Fantasy X*. That's too much for me, if I'm being honest. Now that I got *Persona 3* running on my Steam Deck, I think I can focus on it and get it done before the end of the year.

I also started *Oceanhorn 2* on a whim. I haven't played that much of it, but it seems OK. We'll see if it manages to hold my interest for more than a few hours. So far, it feels like a low-budget *Wind Waker* clone. Which is not a bad thing.
