New year, same report structure with minor changes!

### Purchased:
* Myst remake (Mac/Steam) - Purchased for research for a future project. Runs surprisingly well on an M2 MacBook Air.
* Octopath Traveler (PC/Epic)
* The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV (PC/Epic)

### Completed:
* Tomb Raider (1996) (PC/Steam) - Replay

### Dropped:
* Tales of Arise (PC/Steam) - I was playing for the JRPG club, got sidetracked, and haven't touched it since December. At this point I think I missed the boat, so I'm dropping it for now. I will restart at some point. Maybe. Probably.
* Utawarerumono: Prelude to the Fallen (PC/Steam) - Don't know if I'm going to go back to this. Most likely not.

### Currently playing:
* Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3 Portable (PSP) - Getting very close to the end. I could probably finish it in a weekend if I did nothing else. 
* Monster Hunter World Iceborne (PS4) - Trying to get the Platinum trophy for the Iceborne expansion. Damn those gold crowns.
* Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak (PC/Steam) - With the Friday GWJ group
* Tomb Raider III (PC/Steam) - Replay. Last time I tried to replay this, I stopped in the London section. I managed to get past it last weekend, so I think I will finish the game this time. It's better than I remember. I might add it to the list of TR games I replay at least once a year.

### Planned purchases for 2023:
* ~~The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel 4 (PC)~~ - Purchased
* The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (Switch)

### Priority games for 2023:
* Persona 3 Portable - In progress. Will get to the top of Tartarus... someday!
* Myst remake - Barely touched
* Tales of Arise - Will restart eventually
* The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel III - Started, may decide to restart (or check if there's a recap and read that instead)
* Octopath Traveler
* The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV
* The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom

### Ramblings:
I was really hoping to finish *Persona 3* this month, and I am getting closer and closer to the end (after about 70 hours so far), but I had the (bad?) idea of playing *Tomb Raider III* as well, and that pretty much took over my gaming time for the last two weekends.
