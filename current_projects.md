## Current projects

### SABSL
Current video game development project. This is a visual novel/tactical beach soccer game. Currently in the very early stages, but it is where I spend most of my time. I started work on a prototype in 2021 using the Godot 3.4 engine. In late 2022, I started porting what I had to Godot 4, refactoring everything in the process. 

The game features 4 different types of scenes:
- Visual novel scenes, with backgrounds, character portraits, dialog and dialog choices
- Animated 3D scenes with dialog and no player interaction
- 3D exploration scenes, where the player can walk around and talk to NPCs
- Tactical soccer scenes

At the moment, my focus is still in bringing the development I did in Godot 3.4 to Godot 4. Despite some differences between the versions, I haven't encountered any major issue so far.

### Gumn√°sion
This is a web comic project, currently only visible to close and trusted friend. It takes place in a gym, where folks discuss pretty much anything I can think of while exercising. It is made up of short stories, each featuring a specific discussion topic.

I drew the first stories by hand. I have since moved to drawing on the iPad. I am not sure if I will keep doing it this way, I miss working on paper, and I find the results more esthetically pleasing (though I'm sure I could make them look similar if I knew more about digital art).

### Things to learn
- Drawing (figure drawing, basic anatomy, composition)
- Graphic design
- Godot engine
- Blender
- Japanese
- SAP CPI (for work, obviously, and quite possibly the thing I am least motivated to learn)
