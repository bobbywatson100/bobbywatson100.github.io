Hi! My name's Mathieu.

I am a programmer, working mostly with the SAP ERP platform. But, some time ago, I thought it would be nice to try my hand at making a video game. So, like every good developer, I wanted to start a blog to document my progress! I already had a (very neglected) video gaming blog, and I thought I should just add to it and ignore the disconnect. 

Themes discussed on this blog:

- Me doing my best to make a videogame
- Me occasionnaly playing videogames
- Whatever else goes through my mind that I don't mind sharing publicly

The game I am currently making is a mix of visual novel, dating sim, and tactical, turn-based beach soccer. I think I was in the middle of my second rewatch of *Ted Lasso* and playing through *Retired Men's Nude Beach Volleyball League* when I came up with it.

The current layout of this blog is still a WIP, and will change over time.
